```{r, label = 'chunk1'}
fit <- lm(mpg ~ wt, data = mtcars)
```

Inline code evaluation: The average
weight the cars in the mtcars data set
is `r mean(mtcars[["wt"]]) * 1000`
pounds. The expected mpg for the
cars in the mtcar data set
decreases by `r {{ abs(coef(fit)[1])`
miles per gallon for every
additional 1,000 lbs of
weight.
